Lemlist’s Cold Email Infrastructure and Deliverability Management1. Domain and IP WarmupGradual Ramp-Up for New Senders: Lemlist uses an automated warm-up tool (Lemwarm) to slowly ramp up sending volume on new domains or email accounts. When a new email address is connected, Lemwarm starts by sending just a couple of emails per day and then increases this daily quota incrementally (e.g. +1 email/day for new accounts)[1]. For example, a brand new domain/email might send 2 emails on day 1, 4 on day 2, 6 on day 3, and so on, until it reaches a target of about 30–40 emails per day after a few weeks[1][2]. This slow ramp-up prevents sudden spikes that trigger spam filters and effectively “warms” the domain’s reputation.Lemwarm Network & Engagement: During warm-up, Lemlist doesn’t just send empty emails – it leverages a “premium network” of thousands of real inboxes to exchange messages and engagement. Lemwarm automatically sends emails from your account to other Lemwarm users and simulates human-like interactions (other accounts in the network will open the email, reply to it, and even mark it as important or “not spam” if it landed in the spam folder)[3]. This network (20k+ domains across 150+ countries) provides positive engagement signals to inbox providers, boosting your domain’s credibility[4][5]. Essentially, Lemwarm creates organic-looking conversations that teach email providers that your new domain/IP is trustworthy. If any warm-up email does land in spam, Lemwarm will attempt to “pull it out” (for instance, by the receiving Lemwarm agent moving it to inbox)[3], thereby improving your sender reputation.Step-by-Step Warm-up Process: Before any campaigns are sent, Lemlist guides users through technical setup (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, etc.) as a prerequisite[6]. Once that’s done, the warm-up process is initiated on autopilot: you set the desired maximum emails per day for warm-up (e.g. 30/day for new accounts) and an increment rate (e.g. +1 per day), then start Lemwarm[7][2]. Over ~3–5 weeks, the sending volume is gradually increased until the daily limit is reached[8]. Lemwarm sends out emails with realistic content (or even your actual email templates if using the advanced “Smart” warm-up plan[9]) and generates replies within the network. Throughout this period, Lemlist provides a deliverability score dashboard showing your progress – typically accounts move from “Orange: warming up” to “Green: optimal deliverability” by the end of the warm-up phase[10]. Lemlist recommends keeping the warm-up running continuously even after this initial phase[11]. By continuing to send a trickle of Lemwarm emails each day, your domain maintains a solid reputation even as you start cold email campaigns, since the warm-up network’s positive engagement counteracts the potentially lower engagement of cold outreach.Warming Up IP Addresses: In most cases, Lemlist relies on the IPs of your email provider (e.g. Gmail’s or Outlook’s infrastructure), which are already “warmed up” in the sense of being trusted by recipient servers. However, if you use a custom SMTP server with a dedicated IP, you need to warm up that IP similarly. Lemlist’s strategy of gradually increasing send volume inherently serves to warm up a dedicated IP as well – by not exceeding low volumes initially, the IP builds a sending reputation. The platform’s guidance for custom SMTPs is to start around 100 emails/day or less and slowly scale based on results[12]. In practice, if you were to replicate Lemlist’s approach, you would ensure any new IP starts with very low send counts (a few dozen per day) and ramps to higher counts over several weeks, while monitoring bounce/complaint rates. Lemlist’s warm-up automation can handle this because it controls the send rate; if you were doing it manually, you’d adjust your SMTP sending limits or use an IP warm-up plan provided by your ESP. The key is never to “cold start” a new IP/domain with bulk email – Lemlist avoids this entirely by enforcing warm-up first.Warm-Up Tools and Automation: Lemlist’s built-in warm-up (Lemwarm) is essentially an automation tool specialized for deliverability. It runs in the background once activated. Notably, Lemwarm operates via IMAP/SMTP or API connections to your inbox[13] – it uses IMAP to read incoming warm-up emails and send replies, ensuring it follows the email provider’s rules and limits. This makes the process safe and provider-compliant (e.g. it sends at times and volumes that mimic normal user behavior)[13]. Other than Lemwarm, there are third-party tools that do similar warm-ups (e.g. Mailwarm, Warmbox, etc.), but Lemlist has this natively integrated, which tightly couples warm-up with your campaign sending schedule. In summary, any new domain plugged into Lemlist goes through a thorough warm-up regimen: proper DNS setup, then gradually increasing internal emails (with replies) over a few weeks, all to build up sender reputation before you email your first cold prospect.2. Email Sending Strategy & InfrastructureMail Provider Integrations (SMTP vs API): Lemlist is designed to send emails through the user’s own email service, rather than through Lemlist’s servers. You connect your email account to Lemlist, and the platform sends messages on your behalf. For Gmail and Microsoft (Office 365/Outlook) accounts, Lemlist uses OAuth API integration – this means it uses Google’s Gmail API or Microsoft’s Graph API to send emails from your account, which is secure and keeps within provider sending rules[14]. This API-based approach is recommended for better reliability and tracking (since it has direct access to the mailbox for reading sends, drafts, etc.)[14]. For other email providers or custom email setups, Lemlist allows SMTP/IMAP connections: you provide the SMTP server, port, and login credentials, and Lemlist’s system will send via SMTP and can optionally use IMAP to log interactions. Both methods achieve the same result – emails come “from” your address (with your domain’s SMTP or your provider’s IPs) – but the API integrations often have built-in safeguards (e.g. Gmail’s API enforces the 500/day limit and sends failure callbacks). By leveraging user-provided providers, Lemlist avoids using any shared IP that could be tainted; instead it uses high-reputation channels like Gmail’s infrastructure or your own domain’s mail server. This strategy offloads the base deliverability to those providers (which ISPs inherently trust more than unknown servers) while Lemlist focuses on workflow, scheduling, and optimization on top of it.Email Infrastructure & Sending Architecture: Under the hood, Lemlist’s platform manages a scheduling queue for all connected email accounts. Users can set up campaigns (sequences of emails) and Lemlist will send those emails out via the connected accounts at the appropriate times. Lemlist’s sending algorithm ensures that the emails are throttled and distributed over time rather than sent in a burst[15]. For example, if you schedule 100 emails to go out in a day, Lemlist might send roughly one every few minutes during working hours, rather than 100 all at once. This is crucial: sending too many emails too fast looks like bot/spam behavior[16][17]. Lemlist explicitly spreads emails throughout the day “naturally”[18]. The platform allows users to define the sending window (e.g. only send between 9am and 5pm in the recipient’s timezone) and an interval like “reach a new lead every 20 minutes”[19][20]. The algorithm then queues up emails accordingly.Importantly, Lemlist also respects provider limits and user-defined limits. Gmail, for instance, has a known send limit (~500 emails/day on free accounts, ~2000/day on Workspace) and Outlook around 300/day. Lemlist actually recommends staying well below those hard caps – generally <100 emails per day per inbox for cold outreach is advised[12]. Users can set a daily send quota in their Lemlist settings (for example, cap at 50/day or 100/day)[21][22], and Lemlist will not exceed that. In fact, if a campaign could potentially go over the limit, Lemlist will automatically pause or defer sends to the next day to protect the account[23]. This ensures you don’t accidentally burn out an email account by sending too much. The platform’s sending algorithm monitors bounce rates and other signals dynamically – if it sees an increase in bounces (perhaps indicating poor list quality or a problem on the receiving end), it will slow down the send rate to prevent further damage[24]. Likewise, a sudden drop in open rates might signal emails hitting spam, which the algorithm takes as a cue to be cautious[24]. New domains are automatically treated more delicately: Lemlist knows the domain age and will enforce a “new domain warm-up” sending pace (very low volume initially) as part of the algorithm[25].Rotation of Domains, Inboxes, and IPs: A key strategy for large-scale sending is to distribute emails across multiple sender identities to avoid overloading any single domain or IP. Lemlist facilitates this through a feature called “Email Inbox Rotation.” This allows a user (or team) to attach multiple email senders to the same campaign[26]. For example, if you have 3 sales reps each with their own email address (possibly even on different domains), you can combine them in Lemlist so that a campaign to 300 leads gets split – each address might only send 100 emails, which is much safer per inbox. By splitting outreach over multiple mailboxes and domains, you reduce the per-sender volume, and thus lower the risk of spam flagging[27][28]. Lemlist even suggests that sending more than ~200 emails/day from one domain can hurt deliverability[28]; with rotation, you stay well under that on each domain. The platform will randomly assign or round-robin leads to different connected inboxes, so each inbox ends up sending to a portion of the list[29][30]. This rotation strategy is a big advantage when scaling – it’s how some Lemlist users send hundreds or even thousands of emails per day in campaigns: not from one account, but from dozens of accounts operating in parallel. All of this is managed within one Lemlist campaign, which saves users from juggling separate campaigns manually.In terms of IP rotation, since Lemlist mostly uses the IPs of whichever email service is connected, it doesn’t manually rotate IP addresses in the traditional sense (like an SMTP service might rotate through a pool of IPs). Instead, IP diversification comes from using multiple email providers or domains. For instance, if one campaign uses 5 Gmail accounts and 5 Outlook accounts, by nature you are sending from a variety of IP addresses (Google’s and Microsoft’s servers). If a user connects custom SMTP servers, they could connect multiple such servers (perhaps each on different IPs) as separate senders and achieve IP rotation that way. The philosophy is more about domain/inbox rotation at the user level rather than low-level IP rotation. That said, advanced senders could set up multiple sending IPs behind one SMTP, but that is external to Lemlist – Lemlist would just treat them as one SMTP pool. In summary, Lemlist’s rotation strategy focuses on using many sender accounts and domains to spread out sending. This approach mitigates risk: if one domain gets a bad reputation or hits a hiccup, the others are still fine, and no single IP or domain is sending a massive volume. Lemlist essentially bakes horizontal scaling into the product: need to send more? Add more inboxes rather than cranking one inbox’s volume to the max[31].Sending Cadence and Timing: Lemlist also gives granular control over when emails go out. Users can configure schedules so that emails only send on weekdays or specific days, and within certain hours. This is important because sending an email at 3 AM to a business prospect might look odd (and could be a spam signal). By default, Lemlist uses “office hours” in the user’s timezone (e.g. 9am-5pm) as the sending window[20], but this can be adjusted. Furthermore, Lemlist can randomize some elements like email send times or email content (with spin-text or variable snippets) to avoid patterns. All these tactics – spreading sends over time, randomizing intervals, and rotating senders – combine to make Lemlist’s sending pattern appear very human and organic, which is crucial for deliverability.3. Deliverability Management and MonitoringDeliverability Score and Dashboard: Lemlist provides a specialized deliverability dashboard (especially through Lemwarm) to help users monitor the health of their outreach. Central to this is the Deliverability Score – a score out of 100 that indicates how likely your emails are landing in inbox vs. spam[32]. A higher score is better, and Lemlist generally advises that you stay above 90[32][33]. This score is computed based on several factors, including the results of your warm-up emails (inboxes vs spam), your engagement metrics, and any technical setup issues. The dashboard breaks down key indicators that affect deliverability: for example, it shows the percentage of your warm-up emails that landed in spam vs inbox, any “blacklist signals” detected, and whether your DNS/authentication is properly configured[34][35]. It essentially gives you a real-time inbox placement test – if your deliverability score starts dropping or some warm-up emails go to spam, that’s an early warning that your real campaign emails might soon land in spam as well[36][37]. This is more proactive than traditional campaign metrics; it’s constantly testing the waters of various email providers through the Lemwarm network.Inbox Placement Testing: The way Lemlist (via Lemwarm) monitors inbox placement is by using its network of addresses as seed accounts. When Lemwarm sends out emails from your address, those go to many different email services (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc. across 10k+ users). The system then checks where those emails landed – since Lemlist has programmatic access (IMAP) to those recipient inboxes, it can see if your email ended up in the Spam folder or the primary Inbox. These findings feed into your deliverability score. This is akin to running an inbox placement test with seed list emails, but it’s happening continuously in the background. Lemlist will alert you if, say, a significant portion of your warm-up emails are getting flagged as spam (which could indicate something like your domain is on a blocklist or your content is tripping filters)[34][35]. Additionally, Lemlist offers a free “Spam Score Checker” tool (on lemwarm.com) where you can test your email content deliverability. This tool can give you a score and insights (it might, for example, send your email through common spam filters or to test addresses and report the outcome)[38]. While Lemlist’s warm-up primarily focuses on technical and engagement factors, this spam score checker focuses on content and format – ensuring your email isn’t likely to be flagged due to keywords or formatting. Using these in combination, a Lemlist user can test both the content of their emails and the sending reputation before going full blast.Engagement Metrics Tracking: Once you start sending campaigns, Lemlist tracks all the standard email metrics which double as deliverability signals. This includes bounce rates, open rates, click-through rates, and reply rates. All tracking is done in a way to maximize deliverability: Lemlist encourages setting up a custom tracking domain so that open tracking pixels and click links use your own domain (this prevents spam filters from seeing a generic third-party tracking URL, which can be a red flag)[39]. With a custom tracking domain configured, Lemlist embeds an invisible pixel in your emails for open tracking and rewrites your hyperlinks to go through that domain (which then redirects to the final URL) – thereby logging the click. In the dashboard, you can see your open and reply rates; a significantly low open rate (e.g. much below 50% on cold email, which Lemlist considers an indicator of spam issues[40]) might indicate many emails are going to spam and not being seen. Lemlist has stated benchmarks for healthy cold email metrics from a deliverability standpoint: bounce rate below 5%, open rate ideally above ~45%, and spam complaint rate below 0.1%[41][42]. They use these thresholds to give feedback – if your metrics stray outside these, it’s a sign to adjust your strategy (clean your list, tweak content, etc.).Bounce Handling: When Lemlist sends emails, it handles any bounce messages that come back. If an email hard-bounces (e.g. “user not found” or other permanent failure), Lemlist will mark that lead as “bounced” in your campaign and typically stop further follow-ups to that address (no sense emailing an invalid address again). High bounce rates hurt your sender reputation, so Lemlist emphasizes list cleanliness – they even have list verification tools in their ecosystem (like an email verifier and recommending services like Bouncer or Debounce)[43][44]. On the platform, if your bounce rate exceeds a certain percentage (around 5%), that will negatively impact the deliverability score. The Lemlist sending algorithm, as noted, will also react to bounce spikes by slowing down sends[24], essentially to limit the damage and give you a chance to fix the issue (e.g. pause and clean your list). In terms of implementation, when using Gmail/Outlook via API, bounce notifications might not be directly provided, so Lemlist likely detects bounces by either reading the bounce emails via IMAP or via SMTP callback for SMTP senders. The system likely parses any incoming “Mailer Daemon” messages to classify soft vs hard bounces. This is a critical part of deliverability management – ensuring you don’t keep sending to bad addresses which could get your domain blacklisted.Spam Complaint and Feedback Loops: Since Lemlist sends through user email accounts, traditional ISP feedback loops (FBL, where ISPs inform bulk senders of spam complaints) aren’t directly available as they would be for, say, an ESP like MailChimp. Gmail and Outlook don’t report individual spam complaints to senders in a straightforward way for user-to-user emails. However, Lemlist can infer spam issues through other means. The warm-up network is one – if Lemwarm sees emails landing in spam, that’s a proxy for “if a real user might have marked it as spam.” Also, if a connected Gmail account gets a Google warning or block due to suspected spam activity, that’s a strong signal; Lemlist’s help guides address what to do if a Google account is flagged (e.g. stop sending for a few days, then resume with lower volume)[45][46]. Lemlist likely relies on their deliverability score system and user behaviors (opens/replies) to gauge if emails are going to spam rather than on direct complaint feedback. Additionally, Lemlist encourages best practices that reduce complaints: clearly providing an unsubscribe link, personalizing emails, and targeting the right audience so that recipients are less inclined to mark you as spam. The platform allows easy insertion of an unsubscribe link in campaigns, and if a recipient unsubscribes (clicks that link), Lemlist will automatically exclude them from future sends. This indirectly helps deliverability because continuing to send to someone who doesn’t want your emails could lead them to hit “Report Spam”. By removing uninterested recipients proactively, Lemlist helps keep complaint rates extremely low (they cite an acceptable spam complaint rate as <0.08%, which is very low)[47].Content and Spam Words Analysis: Lemlist often educates users on avoiding “spam trigger words” (like “free money”, “buy now”, etc.) and excessive punctuation or ALL-CAPS that can trip content filters. While composing emails in Lemlist, users can utilize the Spam Score Checker (available on their site) to evaluate their email content’s spamminess. This tool likely runs the content through SpamAssassin or a similar rules engine to generate a score. Lemlist’s deliverability resources also advise on email formatting: e.g., write like a human, don’t use too many images or links in the first email, avoid large attachments, and so forth[44][48]. They stress using a business domain email (not a free @gmail address) and making sure your domain name is reputable (a domain with a history of spamming won’t do well)[49][50]. The Lemwarm “Smart” plan can even take a sample of your actual cold email and include it in warm-up sends to see how it performs, essentially testing the content in the safety of the warm-up environment. If that content consistently lands in spam in warm-up, you know to change it before you send it to real prospects[9]. This is a very clever way Lemlist manages deliverability – by validating content and strategy in a controlled environment first.Blacklist Monitoring: Lemlist keeps an eye on whether your sending domain or IP might be blacklisted on major blacklists. The Lemwarm dashboard will surface “blacklist signals” if any are found[35]. It checks services and databases (like Spamhaus, Barracuda, etc.) for your domain and perhaps the IP addresses used by your SMTP. If you do appear on a blacklist, Lemlist will alert you so you can take action (like pausing emails and working to get delisted)[51][52]. This is important because being blacklisted can drastically affect deliverability (emails will bounce or be rejected by many servers). By monitoring this, Lemlist helps users react quickly – for example, if your domain is on a blacklist, you might switch to a backup domain for sending or focus on resolving the issue before continuing your campaign. On the prevention side, Lemlist’s warm-up and sending limits are designed to avoid the behaviors that lead to blacklisting (e.g. high spam trap hits or high unknown-user bounce rates). The continuous warm-up sends also effectively act like canaries: if something you did caused a blacklist (say you hit a spam trap), the warm-up emails might start going to spam or failing, tipping you off even before your actual campaign emails suffer too much.In short, Lemlist’s deliverability management is a combination of proactive measures (warm-up, authentication, content checks) and reactive monitoring (scores, alerts for spam placement and blacklists). Users get a clear picture of their sending health, and the system itself adapts sending speed based on that health. All these insights are fed back to the user so they can adjust their strategy – for example, Lemlist will show deliverability “tips” or warnings in the dashboard (like “your deliverability score is dropping, consider reducing volume or checking content”)[53][54]. This tight feedback loop means senders can course-correct quickly, which is vital in cold email where things can go south fast if not monitored.4. Safeguards and Anti-Spam MeasuresEnforcing Authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC): Lemlist places heavy emphasis on proper email authentication as a safeguard. Before you send a single campaign, Lemlist prompts you to set up SPF and DKIM records for your domain, and to publish a DMARC policy[55]. These DNS records ensure that receiving servers can verify your emails are legitimately from your domain and haven’t been tampered with. In practice, during the Lemlist onboarding or technical setup, there’s a checklist that won’t turn green until you’ve correctly configured SPF (authorizing Lemlist/your mail server IPs to send for your domain), DKIM (cryptographic signature that Lemlist or your mail server attaches to each email), and DMARC (which ties it together and can request reports)[6][56]. Lemlist even provides a one-click “Technical setup checker” to verify that all these records (plus MX and tracking domain) are in place and correct[57][58]. If something is missing or incorrect, they guide you to fix it. This not only improves deliverability but is a strong anti-spam/anti-phishing measure: emails that lack SPF/DKIM are much more likely to be flagged or rejected[59]. In fact, Lemlist will not allow you to start the Lemwarm warm-up if your DNS settings aren’t properly configured[60] – essentially using the carrot of warm-up to force users to do the right thing with authentication. This protects both the user and the larger email ecosystem (since unauthenticated emails can be exploited). By requiring DMARC (with at least monitoring), Lemlist also helps users get feedback if anything is misaligned – DMARC aggregate reports can show if any source is sending unauthorized emails using your domain, which is useful intel.Custom Tracking Domains: Another safeguard is the use of custom tracking domains (CTD) for link tracking and open tracking. If all Lemlist users were to use a generic tracking domain like “trk.lemlist.com”, that domain could quickly accumulate a bad reputation (spam filters might learn that lots of spammy cold emails have links pointing there). To avoid this, Lemlist enables each user to use their own domain for tracking. For example, you might set up a CNAME like links.yourcompany.com pointing to Lemlist’s tracking server. In Lemlist settings, you plug that in so the system knows to use it[61][62]. Now all opens and clicks appear to recipients as hitting yourcompany.com, which maintains consistency and trust. Lemlist’s help guides walk users through setting up this custom tracking domain in a few steps[63]. This feature is a direct safeguard for domain reputation: it prevents your links from revealing a pattern that spam filters could use to group all Lemlist users together. Instead, each user’s tracking domain is unique. Additionally, using HTTPS and a valid SSL (which Lemlist likely provisions via Let’s Encrypt or similar for the tracking domain) avoids security warnings. From a build-your-own perspective, this is something Lemlist did very well – many email tools miss this and their users’ links get blocked by security filters (because the same tracking domain is overused). Lemlist essentially ensures every aspect of the email looks like it comes from the user’s own domain.Automated Safeguards in Sending Algorithm: Lemlist’s system has built-in automated checks to protect users from themselves (and from harming overall deliverability). One such safeguard is auto-pausing of sending if things go awry. For example, if your Gmail account gets temporarily blocked by Google (which can happen if Google detects unusual activity), Lemlist will detect the sending errors and pause further emails, preventing a flood of failures and potential aggravation of the issue[23][64]. Similarly, as noted, if Lemlist calculates that sending the rest of the campaign today would exceed your daily limit or the provider’s limit, it will pause and resume later rather than forcing it[23]. The platform also responds to spam-related triggers: an example is if a large number of your Lemwarm warm-up emails suddenly land in spam, the deliverability score will drop to “Red” and Lemlist explicitly warns you to stop campaigns until you fix the problem[10]. This red-zone status is effectively an auto-safeguard; it’s telling you that proceeding could get your domain blacklisted. Many users heed this and hold off on sending new cold emails until the score recovers (which Lemlist helps with by continuing warm-up and suggesting fixes). There’s also an auto-throttling behavior: if bounce rate is climbing or open rate plummets, Lemlist slows the send rate in real-time[24]. This gives time for the user to notice the alert and intervene, rather than blindly continuing at full speed into a problem. These algorithmic protections mean the platform is always adjusting to maximize inbox placement.Reputation Protection Policies: On a policy level, Lemlist has an anti-abuse policy and terms of use that forbid certain types of emails (like unsolicited mass spam, dangerous content, etc.)[65]. They monitor accounts, especially new ones, for suspicious behavior. For instance, if someone tries to connect an unusually large number of email accounts or send extremely high volumes right away, that might trigger an internal review. Lemlist’s support team might reach out or in some cases ban users who clearly intend to spam. This is important for the integrity of their warm-up network too – if a user sends spam to other Lemwarm participants, it could undermine the whole network’s credibility. Thus, Lemlist likely has systems to verify new users (perhaps monitoring their first campaigns or requiring business emails only, etc.). The presence of a “Sending Policy” link on their site[66] suggests they enumerate these rules publicly. As a safeguard, Lemlist might also impose limits like: during a free trial or first week, you can’t send more than X emails until your account is “trusted”. Many platforms do this to prevent throwaway accounts from blasting spam.Real-Time Email Content Adjustment: Another interesting safeguard is how Lemwarm emails are handled in your inbox. Lemwarm tags its warm-up emails with a special identifier (e.g., the subject contains “lemwarmup”)[67]. Lemlist instructs users to set up mail filters (for Gmail/Outlook) such that any email with that marker skips the inbox and is archived, and never goes to spam[68]. This way, your inbox doesn’t get cluttered with warm-up conversations (which could confuse a person), but also ensures the warm-up emails are not accidentally deleted or flagged. They explicitly warn not to manually interfere with warm-up emails (don’t delete or reply yourself)[69], because the system is handling them. This safeguard ensures the warm-up process can run continuously without user intervention and without causing nuisance. It’s a small detail but quite important – if a user saw strange emails coming in and started marking them as spam or deleting them, it would undo the warm-up’s benefits. Lemlist’s guidance prevents that scenario.DKIM Rotation and Security: Although not explicitly documented in what we saw, a likely safeguard Lemlist employs is handling DKIM keys and sender identities securely. When a user connects, say, a custom SMTP, Lemlist might generate a DKIM key for that domain (or they rely on the mail provider’s DKIM). Ensuring every email is DKIM-signed (and with alignment for DMARC) is a behind-the-scenes measure that greatly helps avoid spoofing flags. Also, if using their own sending domains (perhaps for things like bounce handling or routing), Lemlist would have set up feedback loops and list-unsubscribe headers. Many modern email systems include a “List-Unsubscribe” header so that recipients using Gmail, for example, see an easy unsubscribe link. Lemlist likely injects this header in campaign emails, as part of being compliance-friendly and to reduce spam reports (people might click “unsubscribe” in the header option instead of “spam”).Protecting IP Reputation: Because Lemlist primarily uses your email provider’s IP, the direct IP reputation is largely under the provider’s domain. However, Lemlist still has an interest in keeping those IPs (like Gmail’s pool) “clean” with respect to your usage. If too many Lemlist users abuse Gmail’s sending, Google could start blocking OAuth apps or throttling. To mitigate this, Lemlist’s system might internally stagger sends across accounts so that, for instance, not all users send emails at exactly the top of the hour (to avoid traffic bursts through their servers to Gmail). Also, the use of OAuth means Lemlist is a verified app with Google/Microsoft – they must maintain that status by following the rules (like not exceeding certain rate limits and complying with Google’s policies). One can consider the entire warm-up and sending algorithm as a giant safety harness: it keeps each user’s sending within reputable bounds, which in turn protects the larger ecosystem (IPs, Lemlist’s app reputation with email APIs, etc.).All these safeguards – from requiring proper DNS setup to automatic throttling and continuous warm-up – are why Lemlist campaigns can scale while keeping deliverability high. They’ve essentially productized responsible sending practices. If any serious deliverability issue arises (high bounce, spam block, blacklist, etc.), Lemlist’s layers of defense catch it or at least mitigate it quickly, thereby protecting the user’s domain and, collectively, the Lemlist user base.5. Infrastructure Replicability: Building a Lemlist-Like SystemIf one were to replicate Lemlist’s cold email system, it would involve re-creating several integrated components and adhering to best practices Lemlist has refined. Below is a breakdown of core components and considerations, along with possible tools or approaches to implement them:Aspect / ComponentLemlist’s ImplementationAlternatives / Notes for DIYDomain & IP Warm-upAutomated warm-up via Lemwarm: gradually increase sending volume (starting with ~2 emails/day and ramping to ~30–40/day over ~4–5 weeks) with a network of real inboxes engaging with those emails[1][4]. Warm-up emails get automatic replies and even get pulled out of spam to improve sender reputation[3]. Lemwarm is always on, keeping the domain “warm” continuously.Use a warm-up service or build your own network of seed accounts. For DIY, you’d create many email accounts (on Gmail, Outlook, custom domains) that send emails to each other. Gradually increase send count per day and have scripts auto-reply and mark not-spam. This is complex to maintain; alternatively, leverage third-party warm-up tools (e.g. Warmbox, Mailreach) that specialize in this. If warming up a dedicated IP on an ESP, implement a ramp-up schedule (e.g. 50 emails first day, doubling weekly) and monitor metrics.Email Sending MethodUses user’s email providers for sending. Gmail and Office365 are integrated via OAuth APIs (sending through Gmail/Outlook servers)[14]; any other provider can be connected via SMTP (sending through that provider’s SMTP IPs). Lemlist itself does not maintain its own large sending SMTP servers – it orchestrates sending through the user’s accounts, ensuring high deliverability by leveraging trusted mail servers.If replicating, integrate with popular email APIs: Gmail API (Google Workspace), Microsoft Graph API, etc., for users to connect accounts securely. Also support generic SMTP for custom mail servers or services like SendGrid, Amazon SES. Ensure your system can handle OAuth token refresh, IMAP for reading emails, and SMTP fallback if needed. Alternatively, one could send directly via an ESP’s API (e.g. send via SendGrid’s API), but then you must manage sender identities and IP reputation yourself – using user-provided accounts is simpler for deliverability starting out.Sending Scheduler & ThrottlingLemlist’s backend includes a scheduler that respects user-defined daily limits (e.g. max 50 emails/day per inbox)[70] and spreads sends throughout the day (e.g. “email every 15–20 minutes” pacing)[15]. It monitors performance: if bounce rate spikes or other issues, it auto-slows the send rate[24]. Campaign steps (follow-ups) are sent with configured delays (e.g. 3 days after first email) in a stateful sequence.You’d need a job queue system to handle email send jobs. For instance, use a queue like Redis or RabbitMQ to enqueue each email with a timestamp. Workers or cron jobs then send emails at the right time. Implement per-account counters to not exceed daily/hourly limits. Include random jitter in send times to avoid a fixed pattern. Monitor sending results: your sending workers should capture SMTP/API responses – on errors (bounces, quota exceeded), adjust future sends or pause campaigns. A database (SQL or NoSQL) should track each lead’s position in the sequence and next scheduled step. There are libraries for scheduling tasks or you might use a workflow engine for sequences. Key is to throttle globally and per inbox.Multiple Sender RotationLemlist supports multiple senders in one campaign (“Inbox Rotation”). A user can connect several email addresses (even on different domains) and Lemlist will randomly assign outgoing emails across them[27]. This is managed in the app: you attach inboxes to a campaign, and Lemlist handles distribution and ensures each sender obeys its own sending limit. This effectively multiplies outreach while keeping each inbox under safe limits[28][31].To replicate, design the campaign model to support multiple “from” addresses. For each outgoing email task, pick a sender from the pool – could be round-robin or weighted random. Keep track of how many emails each sender has sent that day and their individual limit. If one reaches its cap, temporarily use the others. You’ll also need to route replies to the correct inbox (so track which lead was contacted by which sender). Using multiple domains: ensure each account’s domain has proper DNS records. If doing IP rotation at SMTP level, you could assign different sending IPs per sender as well. The logic can be custom or use existing automation tools to split lists, but integrating it gives a seamless experience.Open/Click TrackingLemlist uses tracking pixels and tracked links via a custom tracking domain for each user[39]. An open pixel image is served from a user-specific subdomain (CNAME to Lemlist’s servers), logging opens. Links in emails are rewritten to go through this tracking domain (e.g. click redirects hit link.yourdomain.com which Lemlist logs and then forwards to the real URL). This way, engagement is tracked per email, and using the user’s domain for tracking avoids spam filters associating links with a known spam domain.Implement an open tracking service: e.g., an API endpoint that serves a 1x1 transparent image and logs the request (including which email/lead it corresponds to). Use unique identifiers in the image URL for each email sent. For click tracking, set up a redirect service: when composing emails, replace hyperlinks with links to your service (e.g. generate a short unique path that maps to the real URL + email ID). When a recipient clicks, your service logs it and then redirects to the real URL. Use distinct tracking domains per customer if possible (you can have customers configure a CNAME). This requires hosting a web service that can handle a lot of small requests quickly (something like Node.js or Go can do this, and a database or in-memory store to map tracking IDs to target URLs).Bounce & Reply HandlingLemlist handles bounces by reading them as they come. For SMTP sends, it likely gets bounce emails delivered to the sender address’s inbox; Lemlist (via IMAP) can detect those and mark the contact as bounced. For Gmail/API sends, it may rely on Gmail’s detection of bounced addresses or parse the bounce message content. Replies from leads are fetched into Lemlist’s Unified Inbox – Lemlist connects to each sending account’s inbox (via IMAP or API) to pull in any replies from your prospects, so you can see and respond within Lemlist. It also auto-detects a reply as an event to stop further sequence emails to that lead.For DIY, implement IMAP listeners or periodic fetch for each connected inbox. Libraries exist for IMAP in many languages; you’d need to log in and search for new messages, or use push notifications if the email provider supports it (Gmail API has push for new emails). Filter for replies (could be anything not from your own domain that is in response to a sent email) and for bounce messages (which often come from “mailer-daemon” or have certain headers). Parse the bounce to categorize it (hard vs soft). Mark the email address as bounced in your database to avoid sending again. For replies, mark the lead as replied and halt any pending sequence steps for them. Building a unified inbox UI requires storing those reply messages and possibly threading them with the original emails. It’s essentially building a lightweight email client inside your app. This is complex but doable with IMAP/POP3 or email APIs.Deliverability MonitoringLemlist’s deliverability features include the 0-100 score, tracking of spam placement via the Lemwarm network, and blacklist monitoring[34][52]. It automatically checks DNS records and alerts if SPF/DKIM/etc. are not correct[6][60]. It also monitors sending patterns (bounce/spam rates) and will intervene if they are poor[24]. Blacklist checks are likely done by querying known blacklists for the user’s domain/IP.Replicating this is perhaps the hardest part. You can integrate with deliverability tools: e.g., use APIs like Spamhaus Datafeed or openBL to check IP/domain listings. Also, consider using Gmail Postmaster Tools and Microsoft SNDS – these require domain ownership verification but give insights (you could ask users to share access to their Postmaster data). For spam placement, you could maintain a set of test inboxes (seed accounts) at various providers (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.) and periodically send test emails from users’ accounts to these seeds to see if they land in spam. This can be automated but requires upkeep (ensuring the seed accounts don’t get shut down and actually receive the emails). Content spam scoring can be done using SpamAssassin or a service like MailTester. Also implement a DNS check routine: after user inputs their domain, use a DNS library to verify SPF record includes the needed servers, check DKIM by sending a test email or using an online DKIM checker, and confirm a DMARC record exists. You might provide a dashboard with a “health check” list similar to Lemlist. Some aspects (like Lemlist’s internal network data) are not trivial to replicate without a large user base, so early on you might rely more on external tools and gradually build your own network of seed inboxes as you grow.Compliance & Anti-AbuseLemlist has usage policies and likely algorithms to detect spammy behavior. They enforce opt-out links and include List-Unsubscribe headers. The system can auto-stop campaigns if something looks very wrong (e.g., too many errors). They also likely verify new users (maybe via business email domains or manual review) to prevent throwaway spam accounts. Warm-up emails are given special handling (filtered from inbox) to not inconvenience users[68]. Overall, Lemlist’s reputation (and that of their Lemwarm network) is protected by carefully onboarding senders and continuously measuring results.In a DIY system, you must bake in anti-abuse from day one. Require email verification and perhaps company info on signup. Monitor the content of emails being sent – you can flag certain keywords or if a user is sending the same email to thousands of contacts without personalization (a red flag). Implement rate limiting globally: e.g., new accounts cannot send more than X emails in first week. Include an unsubscribe link in every email (you can make this mandatory in templates) and track clicks on it to auto-suppress those contacts. Handle complaints – if a user’s emails consistently get low opens or you receive spam reports (perhaps via people replying “remove me” or via feedback from your own seed accounts marking them spam), intervene. You may even need to ban users who clearly violate rules. Technically, ensure your sending infrastructure (if any shared IP or domain) isn’t compromised: you might sandbox each user’s sending to only their connected accounts to avoid one bad actor affecting others. Logging and auditing is important: keep logs of which user sent what (for troubleshooting and abuse investigation). As you scale, an “abuse desk” or automated alert system is vital (e.g., alert if any campaign has >X% bounce or complaint).Scaling and Architecture Considerations: Lemlist has achieved significant scale – according to their team, they send over 1.2 million emails per day across ~40k users[71]. To replicate such scale, your system’s architecture needs to be robust and distributed. Lemlist likely runs on cloud infrastructure (they mention using OVH cloud and an SRE team to manage availability)[72][73]. This means multiple servers or containers handling concurrent sending, tracking, and the web application. A similar system would benefit from a microservices or modular approach: for instance, a dedicated service for sending emails (workers pulling from queues), a service for tracking opens/clicks, and separate web app servers for the UI and API that users interact with. A central database (or databases) coordinate these.You’d also need to consider data storage: sending that many emails generates a lot of event data (opens, clicks, etc.). Lemlist likely uses a combination of MongoDB (given they use MeteorJS) for primary data storage and perhaps additional analytics stores for events. They use Grafana for monitoring[74], which implies they collect metrics (could be application performance metrics, or possibly campaign metrics piped into a time-series DB for internal monitoring). For your own build, you might start with a single database and then optimize by moving heavy read/write loads (like event tracking) to a specialized store.Recreating Lemwarm’s Network Effect: One of the most challenging parts to replicate is Lemwarm’s large network of participating inboxes. The value of that network is in the diversity and volume of interactions (which an individual trying to warm up on their own can’t easily match). If you are building a new system, you might initially integrate an existing warm-up network via API (some warm-up tools allow external control) or encourage early customers to “warm each other” in a smaller network. Achieving a 10,000 inbox network would require either a big user base or seeding it with a lot of accounts under your control – which can be costly and complex (and runs the risk of those accounts being seen as fake if not done carefully). It might be more practical to allow your system to plug into Lemwarm itself or another established warm-up service until you have volume to justify building your own network.Replicating AI and Optimization: Lemlist mentions using AI for deliverability prediction and sequence optimization[75]. In building your own system, initially you can rely on rule-based heuristics (like those deliverability thresholds and simple if-then adjustments). Over time, with enough data, you could incorporate machine learning – for example, to predict the best time to send emails for engagement, or to analyze which subject lines lead to spam vs inbox (maybe using natural language processing on content). These are advanced features that aren’t strictly necessary in an MVP but can differentiate the platform later. Lemlist’s “Smart Content” and template testing in warm-up are examples of adding intelligence on top of the basic sending.Third-Party Services: A number of external services can help bootstrap some functionality: email verification APIs (to clean lists), anti-spam content APIs (to score content), and even campaign delivery services (some people use marketing automation backends like Mailgun’s API just to handle the actual send and tracking, while building their own front-end logic – though those are more suited to opt-in mail, not cold mail, and may have strict anti-spam terms). If building from scratch, one might use a service like Amazon SES for sending (it gives high deliverability if your emails are clean, but you must warm up SES IPs too). However, using such services means you manage a pool of IPs and must ensure each customer doesn’t get the IPs blocked – a reason Lemlist’s model of using each customer’s own sending channel is clever for cold outreach.Summary of Components: In essence, to replicate Lemlist you need to build: (a) a web application for users to manage contacts and campaigns; (b) integration modules for email providers (OAuth flows, token management, SMTP sending, IMAP reading); (c) a scheduling engine to send emails in a controlled manner; (d) tracking endpoints for opens/clicks and a way to display those analytics; (e) a warm-up and deliverability management service (either in-house or via integration); and (f) a variety of safety checks (DNS setup wizard, blacklist monitor, volume control, etc.). Each of these has its challenges, but none are insurmountable with time and resources. The hardest part is achieving the trusted reputation and data that Lemlist has – purely technical replication won’t immediately grant the same deliverability outcomes without that ecosystem of warm interactions and learned tuning. Nonetheless, the blueprint Lemlist provides is extremely valuable for anyone attempting to build a similar cold email platform.6. Technology Stack and ArchitectureLemlist’s platform is built with a modern web stack, primarily JavaScript/TypeScript based. Notably, Lemlist uses MeteorJS (a full-stack JavaScript framework) on the backend[76]. Meteor provides an integrated solution with Node.js on the server and a client-side framework; in Lemlist’s case they leverage Meteor with a React frontend. This means the application is largely written in JavaScript/TypeScript both on server and client, enabling real-time updates and a unified codebase. Meteor’s use suggests they likely use MongoDB as the primary database (since Meteor traditionally bundles MongoDB) – this would store campaign data, user info, etc., and also enable Meteor’s reactivity (live data push to clients). The choice of Meteor may have allowed the Lemlist team to rapidly develop features like the live feed of email activity and the unified inbox, because Meteor seamlessly pushes database changes to the frontend via websockets.On the frontend, Lemlist uses React for building the UI components[76]. The site is a single-page application where users can create campaigns, edit templates, view analytics, etc., and React handles the dynamic interface. For styling and UX, they likely use common UI libraries or custom design (the exact stack isn’t specified, but given the slick interface, possibly a design system built on top of something like Material-UI or custom CSS-in-JS). The React frontend communicates with the backend via Meteor’s DDP (a websocket protocol) or via REST APIs for certain actions. There is also a separate frontend for Lemwarm (app.lemwarm.com) which likely shares the backend or connects via API – given Lemwarm was spun into its own product interface, they might have a micro-front-end or a separate Meteor app that focuses on the deliverability/warm-up features, using the same database.For the infrastructure, Lemlist is hosted on cloud servers. They have mentioned using OVH (a cloud and hosting provider)[73], which suggests their servers (app, database, etc.) run on OVH’s infrastructure (likely in France, as Lemlist is a French company, which might appeal for data residency for EU customers). They also utilize Cloudflare[77] – probably for DNS management and as a CDN/proxy for their web app and tracking domains. Cloudflare can accelerate content delivery and provide security (DDoS protection, SSL termination). Each user’s custom tracking domain CNAMEs to a Cloudflare-backed domain, meaning Cloudflare also helps manage those numerous subdomains efficiently (wildcard SSL, etc.). Cloudflare might also be caching images or handling the tracking pixel load globally.The team employs Ansible for configuration management[78], which implies they manage their server setup (as opposed to everything being serverless or fully managed). They likely have Ansible scripts to deploy updates, configure environments, and scale up new servers. Continuous integration and deployment is handled with Jenkins[79], which automates building, testing, and deploying the Meteor application. Monitoring is done with Grafana[74] and possibly other tools – Grafana would visualize metrics (could be server metrics, or business metrics like emails sent per minute, etc.). They mention a dedicated SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) effort to maintain uptime and scale, achieving support for 40,000+ users and 2,000 concurrent active users on the system without performance issues[72].For real-time communications (like updating the campaign dashboard when an email is opened or a reply comes in), Meteor’s live data functionality via websockets is used. They might also use Redis under the hood for things like job queues or caching results of expensive operations, although this isn’t explicitly stated. Given the volume of emails, a job queue system is almost certain – Meteor’s basic architecture might not handle millions of email sends by itself, so they possibly have separate worker processes (could be implemented as Node microservices or Meteor worker instances) to manage sending outside of the web request loop. If so, those workers would take tasks from a queue (perhaps backed by MongoDB or Redis) and execute sends in parallel.Lemlist’s developer API suggests they have a RESTful or GraphQL API for external integrations (beyond their own web app)[80]. This would be necessary for the integrations they advertise (HubSpot, Salesforce sync, etc.). The API likely exposes endpoints to manage leads, campaigns, etc., and is secured via API keys or OAuth. Implementing an API on top of Meteor can be done with Meteor’s endpoints or a separate Node.js Express app – either way, it’s part of the stack so that Lemlist can integrate into other tools in a sales workflow.On the data side, beyond MongoDB, they might use additional databases: e.g., a relational database for accounting/billing or a specialized search engine (ElasticSearch) for fast search through contacts and emails. The tech stack info doesn’t list these, but it’s common in SaaS to polyglot if needed. They do list Intercom for support chat[81], which is more of a 3rd-party SaaS in their site, and Pipedrive (perhaps they use it internally for sales CRM)[82], which is not directly the product but interesting context that the company itself dogfoods outreach and sales tools.One standout in their tech description is a line about “data/AI pole develops and implements deliverability prediction and sequence creation automation”[83]. This indicates they have a data science team working with the product. They might be using Python or R on the side for building models, but those models likely get integrated back into the JS application. For instance, deliverability prediction could mean an AI that looks at a user’s campaign (content, schedule, past engagement) and predicts risk (maybe feeding into that deliverability score or giving proactive tips). Sequence creation automation might refer to their AI features for generating email text or scheduling – Lemlist has some AI-assisted writing and personalization features. So, they probably use machine learning libraries and possibly host AI models (maybe via Python microservices or cloud AI services) as part of the extended stack.In terms of scalability, Lemlist’s architecture has succeeded in sending millions of emails per week. Meteor can scale with multiple instances and a distributed MongoDB cluster. The fact they mention an SRE team and infrastructure for scaling suggests: load balancers in front of multiple app instances, a sharded or replicated database for handling many connections, and robust monitoring to catch performance bottlenecks. They also highlight maintaining app responsiveness despite the heavy email sending load[84] – meaning they likely separate the concerns of sending (which can be resource-intensive) from the user-facing app. This could be via job queues as mentioned, or by using Meteor’s ability to offload certain processing to background threads or external services. Ensuring emails go out on time while the app stays snappy is a classic challenge; solving it entails good asynchronous design.For someone trying to build a similar system, you don’t necessarily have to use Meteor – you could use any tech stack you’re comfortable with (Node.js/Express, Django, Ruby on Rails, etc.), as long as it supports scheduling and real-time updates. Lemlist’s use of Meteor was a choice likely influenced by the need for real-time UI (like seeing in-app when a prospect opens an email, the user gets a live notification). Other stacks can do this with websockets too (for example, using Socket.io or frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt with server-push, or even serverless functions with something like AWS AppSync for GraphQL subscriptions). The takeaway from Lemlist’s stack is that having a unified, event-driven architecture is key – email sending and tracking is inherently asynchronous, so the tech needs to handle lots of concurrent events and update states.Finally, Lemlist being a part of the “Lempire” suite (including Lemwarm, Lemverify, etc.) implies they design modularly. Lemwarm, while integrated, might run as a separate service for the warm-up network (maybe even on separate servers optimized for handling IMAP/SMTP connections for thousands of accounts). If one were to replicate the warm-up as a microservice, it could be a headless service that logs into accounts, sends warm emails, processes them, and updates scores in the main database. This kind of separation can improve security (the part that stores email account credentials and sends warm emails might be isolated).In summary, Lemlist’s tech stack is a full-stack JavaScript environment, using Node/Meteor on the back, React on the front, MongoDB for data, all hosted on cloud VMs with tools like Cloudflare and Ansible managing the deployment. It’s a scalable, real-time friendly architecture. The choice of Meteor (which automatically provides real-time pub/sub and a cohesive framework) probably accelerated development and ensured that features like live inbox and instant campaign updates worked out-of-the-box. A replicated system could use similar tech or a combination of modern frameworks, but should strive for the same principles: asynchronous processing for email sends, real-time feedback for users, and a solid integration with email provider APIs.Overall, Lemlist marries the worlds of software and email infrastructure: robust software design to handle campaigns, and careful use of email infrastructure (warm-ups, proper SMTP/APIs) to achieve high deliverability. Recreating it is non-trivial, but understanding the above components provides a roadmap for how such a system can be built and scaled.Sources: The information above was synthesized from Lemlist’s official help center and product pages, which detail their warm-up methodology[85][3], sending algorithm[15][24], and deliverability features[34][51]. Lemlist’s tech stack and scale were informed by a profile on their engineering practices[76][71], as well as various Lemlist guides on sending limits and rotation[12][28]. These sources collectively illustrate how Lemlist manages large-scale cold email outreach while maintaining deliverability. The table in section 5 consolidates these practices and suggests alternative implementations, based on industry-standard approaches and the cited Lemlist strategies. Each aspect of the system is tied to a reference from Lemlist’s documentation or related resources for verification.[1] [2] [6] [7] [10] [11] [39] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [85] lemwarm: The Ultimate Email Warm-Up Tool for Boosting Deliverability | lemlist Help Centerhttp://help.lemlist.com/en/articles/9723310-lemwarm-the-ultimate-email-warm-up-tool-for-boosting-deliverability[3] [8] [9] [14] [34] [35] [36] [37] [53] [54] [67] [68] [69] Understanding lemlist and lemwarm bundles | lemlist Help Centerhttps://help.lemlist.com/en/articles/9935910-understanding-lemlist-and-lemwarm-bundles[4] [5] [13] [32] [33] [40] [41] [42] [47] [51] [52] [65] [66] lemwarm - the #1 warm-up tool to make sure you stay out of spamhttps://www.lemlist.com/lemwarm[12] [21] [22] [23] [31] [45] [46] [64] [70] Understand sending limits in lemlist | lemlist Help Centerhttp://help.lemlist.com/en/articles/4508367-understand-sending-limits-in-lemlist[15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [24] [25] Understand lemlist’s sending algorithm | lemlist Help Centerhttps://help.lemlist.com/en/articles/4452763-understand-lemlist-s-sending-algorithm[26] [27] [28] [29] [30] Scale Your Outreach Efficiency: Send 1 Campaign from Multiple Email Addresses with lemlisthttps://www.lemlist.com/inbox-rotation[38] [43] [44] [48] [49] [50] Email Deliverability Test | Spam Score Checker | lemwarmhttps://www.lemwarm.com/deliverability-test[61] Fix link clicks not being tracked | lemlist Help Centerhttps://help.lemlist.com/en/articles/4452718-fix-link-clicks-not-being-tracked[62] Custom Tracking Domain: What It Is & How To Set It Up Easily Best ...https://www.warmforge.ai/blog/custom-tracking-domain[63] Custom tracking domain guide (for email, engagement & - Lemlisthttps://www.lemlist.com/blog/custom-tracking-domain[71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [81] [82] [83] [84] lemlist - Techhttps://www.welcometothejungle.com/en/companies/lemlist/tech-1[80] Integrate your tool stack with lemlisthttps://www.lemlist.com/integrations

Key facts about Peach for accurate claims in cold emails.

## What Peach Is

Peach (www.Peach.Study) is an AI platform that weaves across teaching-learning workflows to help schools deliver personalised learning whilst saving teachers significant time.

## Core Value Proposition

**Primary:** Improve student learning outcomes through genuine personalisation
**Secondary:** Save teachers ~15-16h per week

## How Personalisation Works

Peach personalisation is driven by two forces:

### 1. Superior Diagnosis
Peach diagnoses student knowledge better than humans because:
- **Cross-subject visibility:** Sees all work across subjects (teachers are siloed by subject)
- **Cross-year visibility:** Sees work across years (teachers typically work with students for ~2 years)
- **Home learning capture:** AI tutor captures "invisible" learning at home (doubt resolution, exam revision)
- **Pattern recognition:** AI processes larger data sets to find patterns humans miss

This enables **root cause remediation** rather than repetitive practice of current topics.

### 2. Rapid Content Creation
Peach reduces teacher content creation from hours to minutes:
- **Interest-based contextualisation:** Explains concepts through student's interests (e.g., supply/demand via football transfers vs. Taylor Swift tickets)
- **Expert pedagogy:** AI trained by expert educators
- **Curriculum alignment:** Can be trained on specific school curriculum

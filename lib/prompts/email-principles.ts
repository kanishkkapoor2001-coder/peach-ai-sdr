Core principles for writing effective cold emails to independent/international school leaders.

## 1. Personalise with One Real Detail

Independent school leaders are bombarded with generic edtech pitches. One specific detail is enough:

- Mention their curriculum: IB, A-levels, IGCSE, AP, national curriculum
- Reference something public: strategic plan, digital strategy, AI statement, inspection report
- Note their context: day/boarding, international, multilingual

**Example:**
> I saw that [School] is expanding IB Diploma and developing an AI position statement for parents this year.

## 2. Start from Their World, Not Your Product

Leaders in independent/international schools focus on:
- Pupil outcomes and wellbeing
- Teacher workload and retention
- Parent expectations (and fees to justify)
- Differentiation vs. other schools (results, innovation, character, co-curricular)
- Inspection/accreditation and safeguarding (ISI, Ofsted-equivalents, IB, CIS)

Your opening should sit in that world, not in "we're an AI startup."

**Fallback if nothing personalised found:**
> I know you're balancing exam results, teacher workload, and growing questions from parents about AI in the classroom.

## 3. Lead with a Clear, Simple Value Proposition

One sentence that says:
- **Who** it helps (teachers, heads of department)
- **What** it changes (time saved, better differentiation, feedback quality)
- **How** it fits their constraints (safe, aligned with policies)

**Peach default:**
> Peach weaves AI across teaching-learning workflows to help schools deliver truly personalised learning whilst saving their teachers ~15h a week.

## 4. Address AI Risk, Privacy, and Reputation

In independent schools, reputation with parents and governors is huge. Include one short, reassuring sentence on:
- Data protection & security (GDPR-aligned, no selling data)
- Content safety and alignment with existing school policies

## 5. Keep Emails Extremely Short and Phone-Friendly

**Targets:**
- 100-150 words (125 ideal)
- 3 short paragraphs
- Only one main link (if any)

Heads and deputies read this between lessons, meetings, and gate duty. If they can't skim it in under 10 seconds, it's too long.

## 6. End with Appropriate CTA

**Email 1 (Intro):**
> Would you be open to taking a look at a short 2m video that shows-off what you can do with Peach — or is there someone leading instructional technology/AI adoption whom I should get in touch with instead?

**Email 2 (Value Prop #1):**
> Would you be open to briefly reviewing some material that details how Peach achieves [claim] — or is there someone leading instructional technology/AI adoption whom I should get in touch with instead?

**Email 3 (Value Prop #2):**
> Would you be open to having a quick chat so that I may demonstrate how Peach can [claim]?

**Email 4 (Value Prop #3):**
> May I send you a 2-minute video demo of Peach or, if you prefer, could we schedule a short call to demo?

**Email 5 (Break-up):**
> If this isn't a priority for this term, no problem at all—just wanted to put Peach on your radar as you consider the role of AI in teaching and learning.

## 7. Use Peer-to-Peer, International Tone

Writing to highly educated professionals who work across cultures:
- Neutral, international English (avoid heavy US idioms, "districts")
- No "edtech bro" language ("disrupt," "10x," "revolutionise")
- Respect for constraints: timetables, inspection cycles, parent expectations, fee pressures

**Tone:** Calm, confident, and respectful.

## Subject Line Guidelines

Keep subject lines:
- Short (under 50 characters ideal)
- Curiosity-inducing but not clickbait
- Relevant to recipient's role/school

**Good examples:**
- Quick question about AI at [School]
- Personalisation for [School]'s IB students?
- Teacher workload at [School]
- Following up: AI in teaching

**Avoid:**
- ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation
- Vague subjects ("Quick question")
- Salesy language ("Amazing opportunity!")

## Follow-up Timing

Recommended spacing:
- Email 1 → Email 2: 3-4 days
- Email 2 → Email 3: 4-5 days
- Email 3 → Email 4: 5-6 days
- Email 4 → Email 5: 7 days

Adjust based on school term schedules—avoid term breaks and exam periods.
